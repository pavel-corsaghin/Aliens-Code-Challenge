Curtis Sliwa, a beret-wearing Republican running to be the mayor of New York City, said one of the goals of his campaign is to focus on crypto.\n" +
                            "In a Wednesday tweet, Sliwa said he would be focusing on creating greater financial inclusivity in New York City by opening more crypto ATMs and incentivizing businesses to accept cryptocurrency. According to his campaign website, however, the mayoral candidate currently only accepts donations in U.S. dollars using personal checks or credit cards.\n" +
                            "Sliwa announced his intentions for the adoption of cryptocurrencies in NYC in June, before winning the Republican primary in the city’s mayoral race. The founder of the crime-prevention group Guardian Angels and reportedly the owner of 16 rescue cats, he will face off against Democratic candidate Eric Adams in November.\n" +
                            "Adams, who has also taken a seemingly pro-crypto stance by pledging to make New York City “the center of Bitcoins,” won the Democratic primary against former presidential candidate and crypto advocate Andrew Yang in July. Yang also claimed he wanted to make the city “a hub for BTC and other cryptocurrencies.”",

The National Civil Police, or PNC, released a statement saying Gómez’s detainment was related to an investigation for financial fraud. Otto Flores, Gómez’s lawyer, said authorities released Gómez later that afternoon.\n" +

                            "Gómez has regularly posted on social media about his opposition to legislation set to make Bitcoin (BTC) legal tender in El Salvador on Sept. 7. His Twitter posts include allegations that individuals behind the government’s Bitcoin wallet “Chivo” may be associated with the same BTC address associated with the massive hack of Twitter in July 2020. He has also made No Al Bitcoin (No To Bitcoin) stickers available to his thousands of followers.",

Scaramucci personally believes that Bitcoin could reach \$100,000 before the end of the year.\n" +
